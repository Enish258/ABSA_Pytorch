# ABSA_Pytorch
Aspect-based sentiment analysis(or ABSA) is the task of identifying fine-grained opinion polarity towards a specific aspect in a given context/text/review.
It is a variant of sentiment analysis, but much more insightful. 
For eg-
The camera of this mobile is pretty good but the design is really unflattering.
In this -for aspect 'camera',the review was positive but negative towards the aspect 'design'.
If we develop a system that can predict what the sentiment towards a given review is,it can prove of great value in fields like customer reviews ,movie reviews or even recommendation systems.
To undertand more about it do read the below given papers.
In the given dataset,there were 3 classes-Negative,Neutral and Positive(0 for negative,1 for neutral 2 for positive).
The papers which I have implemented in this project are-
